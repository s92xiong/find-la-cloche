## About This Project

**What does this project do? Why does it exist?**
Find La Cloche is a web application that provides access to a database containing crowdsourced images and reviews for all 34 campsites along the La Cloche Silhouette Trail (LCST) in Killarney, Ontario, Canada. The LCST is a ~100 km, multi-day backpacking trail that requires significant planning and preparation to complete. Campsite reservations are specific to a single location per night, and Ontario Parks does not provide any backcountry campsite images on their website nor detailed information regarding. Thus, this app was built to give backpackers insight into the quality and status of their reserved campsites.
